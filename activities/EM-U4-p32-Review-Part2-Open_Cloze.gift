There are many stories of dolphins helping people in trouble, {1:SA:=like} saving swimmers from shark attacks by gathering round them or shepherding them to safety. {1:SA:=If} these stories are true, why do dolphins do it and {1:SA:=what} makes them behave in this way? Scientists {1:SA:=who~=that} have studied them are not entirely sure. For dolphins to act together as a group to save humans implies that {1:SA:=there} is some sort of code of ethics among dolphins, but there is little evidence  for that. The {1:SA:=most} likely explanation is that they instinctively respond to the appearance of predators like sharks by herding weaker members of their own group into {1:SA:=a} safe place - and there is proof that dolphins do cooperate with {1:SA:=each~=each other} other to ward off danger. Maybe they just mistake swimmers for part of their group, which would mean that dolphins don’t have genuine feelings of kindness towards humans. {1:SA:=It} may be that their smiling appearance simply gives people the wrong idea.
