<p>If Cavendish {1:SA:=hadn't crashed~=had not crashed~=hadn’t crashed} (<i>not crash</i>) in the Tour of Britain he {1:SA:=wouldn't have injured~=may not have injured~=might not have injured~=would not have injured~=wouldn’t have injured} (<i>not injure</i>) his shoulder. However, if he {1:SA:=hadn't had to~=had not had to~=hadn’t had to} (<i>not have to</i>) take eight weeks off training, he’s convinced he {1:SA:=wouldn't have had~=would not have had~=wouldn’t have had} (<i>not/have</i>) the time to plan his strategy for the next season so in fact his enforced rest turned out to be useful. He says that people didn’t believe he could win at the age of thirty-one and that if he {1:SA:=hadn't felt~=had not felt~=hadn’t felt} (<i>not feel</i>) he had to prove people wrong, he {1:SA:=might not have been~=might not have been} (<i>might not be</i>) so determined to train as hard as he did. He also believes he {1:SA:=wouldn't have succeeded~=would not have succeeded~=wouldn’t have succeeded} (<i>not succeed</i>) if the entire team {1:SA:=hadn't supported~=had not supported~=hadn’t supported} (<i>not support</i>) him at all times.</p>
